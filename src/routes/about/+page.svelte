    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>

  <p class="lede">
    I'm a software engineer who builds distributed systems and real-time control software
    for sensors, telescopes, and high-reliability platforms. My work blends
    the worlds of systems engineering and software design — where performance,
    architecture, and physical hardware meet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past few years, I’ve designed and delivered scalable, modular
    control frameworks that integrate asynchronous messaging, device orchestration,
    and fault-tolerant computation. Most of that has been through my work at
    <strong>EO Solutions</strong>, where I’ve helped lead development of
    distributed command-and-control software for telescope networks and hardware-in-the-loop
    systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before that, I worked across both infrastructure and application layers —
    from <strong>cloud automation at Kimberly-Clark</strong> to building
    internal tools and data pipelines with <strong>Azure, FastAPI, and Spring Boot</strong>.
    Earlier roles at startups and design firms taught me to value clarity,
    modularity, and the discipline of good engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m drawn to systems that span boundaries — software that talks to the physical world,
    that has to be predictable, observable, and recoverable when it fails.
    Whether it’s a telescope mount, a message bus, or a cluster of distributed workers,
    I care about making the system’s behavior transparent and controllable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m constantly learning — digging deeper into electrical engineering,
    optics, and astrodynamics. My best days are when I can connect an idea across
    disciplines: writing C++ to drive a piece of hardware, then analyzing its data
    through a Python pipeline.
